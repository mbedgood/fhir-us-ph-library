Hi there
HL7 FHIR Public Health Profiles Library

Current instructions for using  profiles in your IG:

- Copy profile
- Search "lib-copy-" / Replace ""
- Search "http://hl7.org/fhir/us/ph-library" / Replace "\<your IG canonical url\>" (e.g. "http://hl7.org/fhir/us/ecr")
- Use profile in your IG

In the future, the profiles in this IG will be available for re-use by declaring a dependency on this IG and referencing the profile
